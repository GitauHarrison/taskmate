# Task Mate
Heres a basic to do list to keep you accountable of your tasks. Simply register your own user, create a task with a title, due date and description. Each task can have comments made.

When your task is overdue, you will see an "Overdue" message displayed, along with an increment of the overdue task counter in the UI. Once completed, move the task to Done. Otherwise, Delete the task to be lost forever.

Please make sure to remove the <b>test</b> user in <b>web/db.py</b> if you are going to expose this to the Internet.

```bash
  sh docker-compose/run.sh
```

## Roadmap 
Order depends on what I feel like working on when I have the free time ðŸ˜ƒ

- ~~CI/CD pipeline to build image and push to Dockerhub~~ 
- ~~Add pytest coverage (#TODO check out https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest-cov)~~
